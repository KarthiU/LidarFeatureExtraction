# LidarFeatureExtraction


## Overview
This repository contains code for a robot with two main features: autonomous navigation and feature detection. The robot is designed to navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles using a combination of sensors and algorithms. Additionally, it is equipped with a feature detection system that creates a point cloud from LiDAR data and detects features in the surroundings.

## Features
# Robot Navigation
The robot utilizes algorithms to navigate autonomously.
It is capable of avoiding obstacles using sensor data.

# Feature Detection System
Utilizes LiDAR data to create a point cloud representation of the environment.
Implements feature detection algorithms to identify key features in the surroundings.
