# LidarFeatureExtraction


## Overview
This repository contains code for a robot with two main features: autonomous navigation and feature detection. The robot is designed to navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles using a combination of sensors and algorithms. Additionally, it is equipped with a feature detection system that creates a point cloud from LiDAR data and detects features in the surroundings.

## Features
Robot Navigation

The robot utilizes algorithms to navigate autonomously.
It is capable of avoiding obstacles using sensor data.
Built using numpy, scipy, and pygame.
Feature Detection System

Utilizes LiDAR data to create a point cloud representation of the environment.
Implements feature detection algorithms to identify key features in the surroundings.
